# Smart-Waste-Segregation-System

An AI-powered web application that automatically classifies waste materials into 12 categories and provides tailored recycling guidance to promote sustainable waste management practices.

## Features

- **Image Classification**: Upload images or use live camera to identify waste
- **AI-Powered**: Deep learning model based on MobileNetV2 architecture
- **Recycling Guidance**: Detailed recycling methods for each waste category
- **Location-Based**: Find recycling centers in your state
- **QR Integration**: Quick access to recycling centers via QR codes
- **Camera Support**: Real-time waste classification using device camera
- **Confidence Scores**: Transparent AI predictions with probability percentages
- **Web-Based**: Accessible from any device with a browser

   cd Smart-Waste-Segregation-System

**Usage**

Choose Input Method: Select between image upload or camera capture

Provide Waste Image: Upload a clear image or use your camera to capture waste

Get Classification: AI model predicts the waste category with confidence score

View Recycling Guidance: Get detailed recycling instructions for the identified waste

Find Recycling Centers: Locate nearby recycling facilities using the interactive map

**Model Training**

The classification model was trained using transfer learning with MobileNetV2 as the base model:

Dataset: Garbage Classification Dataset from Kaggle

Classes: 12 waste categories

Input Size: 224Ã—224 pixels

Preprocessing: Image normalization (0-1 scaling)

Augmentation: Rotation, flipping, zooming, and shifting

Training: Fine-tuning with custom classification layers

Validation: 80-20 split with early stopping
